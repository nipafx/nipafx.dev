First of all, in case you're looking at this on mobile, I'm sorry that the diagram is unreadable - I haven't figured out the art of responsive diagrams yet. ðŸ˜”

Other than that, I hope you like this sheet and it helps you, should you ever need to build a module by hand.
Why you would need to do that?
Because building modules from the command line is the best way to get to know them.
So if you're [learning what Java's module system has to offer](course-java-module-system), I recommend putting your build tool aside for a day and go old-school.
