Yes, 25 hours of Java! There will be technical deep dives, interviews, discussions, cake, code, more cake, and even more code!
Most importantly, it will be a lot of fun and I hope you join me on that fine Saturday in May.

## Coordinates

Sun Microsystems had their headquarter in California and so we'll pin May 23rd to Pacific Daylight Time (PDT):

*   where Java was born: **11 PM (22nd) to 12 PM (23rd) PDT**
*   where the clock lives: **0600 (23rd) to 0700 (24th) UTC**
*   where I live: **0800 (23rd) to 0900 (24th) CEST**

**Location**: [twitch.tv/nipafx](https://twitch.tv/nipafx)

## Timeline

Here's what I plan to dissect and discuss with you.
I will have slides, repos, and a rough idea where we're going, but the cool thing about a stream is that you're there with me, so you can ask questions, decide what to emphasize, and tell me where to go next.
That also means that the timeline may not be strictly adhered to.
