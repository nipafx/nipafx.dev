## Talks

First things first, here's the list of my talks - if any of them are interesting for your event, [let me know](contact).
More are always in the making and some of them are pretty malleable, so feel free to ask for details and customizations that match your preference.

## Events

### Community Meetings

Local communities like Java User Groups are the backbone of the Java community and presenting there before chit-chatting about Java over snacks and drinks is always great fun.
I'll gladly be there if time permits.

I expect to cover travel expenses myself, but if your group has the means to reimburse them, let me know - it makes it all the more likely I can arrange a visit.
Alternatively, we can look at organizing [a course](courses), either under the meetup's roof or at a local company, or [an in-house presentation](#in-house-events).

### Conferences

I love speaking at conferences, large or small!
Please [hit me up](/contact) if you're organizing one.

They're usually commercial events and in exchange for my time and knowledge I assume they'll cover travel expenses.
In addition to that, we can discuss organizing a [a course](courses) at the event or at a local company.

### In-house Events

Many companies invest into their developers' skills by organizing internal events.
Giving a large group of collaborating coders a leg up on the newest Java developments is a great opportunity to upskill entire teams and directly impact a project's code base.

My common rate for such a presentation (including preparation and follow-up conversations) is **800 EUR**.
Travel expenses are extra, but can be reduced by other activities in the vicinity, most commonly a [community meeting](#community-meetings).

### Remote

Travel expenses aside, everything above holds the same for remote talks.
