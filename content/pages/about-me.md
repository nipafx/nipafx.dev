## Random Musings On The Past

### Java and I

Java and I first met in highschool at the turn of the century (way to make yourself feel old, Nicolai), but I gotta admit, it wasn't exactly love at first sight.
All of that indirection, for what?!
While studying computer science and mathematics at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/) (2004-2010), we got to know and understand one another a bit better.

But it wasn't until I started using it every day at work at [Fraunhofer ISI](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/en.html) (2011-2014) that we really hit it off!
We spent so much time together, my significant other started to get jealous.
After leaving the institute for [Disy Informationssysteme GmbH](https://www.disy.net/en/) (2014-2016), my love to Java spilled over into the public.

It all began with the blog in 2014 and from there snowballed to conferences, books, YouTube and Twitch - all the things I mentioned above.
For a few years, I was the editor of [Sitepoint's Java channel](https://www.sitepoint.com/java/), a freelancing developer and author, and an independent trainer.
In 2019, I became [Java Champion](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=119297:3::::::).

But the cherry on the ice cream sundae, something I would never have thought, is that seven years later I'd be working at Java's source as a developer advocate for Oracle.

### Why nipafx?

I occasionally get asked why nipa_fx_, is it the same fx as in JavaFX?
Capitalization aside, yes. üòä
If you find that weird, I hear you, but it was pretty much an accident.
Here's what happened.

Back in 2014, I dabbled with JavaFX.
I created a few controls and some helper methods before eventually learning about [ControlsFX](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx) (same FX).
I contributed [a control](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/wiki/ControlsFX-Features#snapshotview) to the project and took inspiration from its name when starting a project for the helper methods.
I thought CodeFX (same FX) would make a nice companion, so I got the domain codefx.org and registered it with Maven Central.

At about the same time, I decided to give blogging a shot.
Need a name and domain for that as well.
Being all out of ideas, I decided on a switcharoo:

* use codefx.org for the blog
* rename still unpublished library to LibFX (same FX)
* use `org.codefx.libfx` as group ID

Come October (still 2014), I got on Twitter and needed a name for _that_ as well.
My first choice, @CodeFX, was taken.
@NicolaiParlog is way too long, @nicolai was taken and so were @nipa and all reasonable derivations, so what to do?!
Once again invited to be creative, I wasn't and picked _nipafx_ (same FX).

<contentimage slug="creativity-not-today" options="sidebar"></contentimage>

To me, that was just a user handle and I never thought of it as even a nickname until I started to meet people at JUGs and conferences who knew me from Twitter and thought of me primarily as nipafx.
A few more years down the road... now I _am_ nipafx.
(But you can call me Nicolai. üòÅ)

### What Happened To CodeFX?

So what happened to CodeFX?
It was too good a name.
You might be thinking that's an upside, but that's only true for the first person to use it.
Everybody else struggles to get this user name on the platforms they want to use.

My blog was _codefx.org_, on Twitter I was _nipafx_, on Google+ (remember that?) I was _NicolaiParlog_, on YouTube I managed to get _codefx_ as vanity URL, but on GitHub I was _nicolaiparlog_ with _CodeFX-org_ as an organization (why both?!).
On Twitch _codefx_ was taken as well, so I used _nipafx_.
What a mess!

Then, in 2019, lightning struck (figuratively) when I watched [this video by Ben Claremont](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVeKtq6QJKk).
I realized that there's no reason to put an artificial entity between you and me and that CodeFX would have to die.
More details in [this newsletter](https://medium.com/nipafx-news/late-hello-to-2019-3de73659b061#cb9d) from back then but long story short:
Now it's _nipafx_ everywhere.

## Bio

I was born in Dortmund, Germany, where I studied mathematics and computer science. In November 2010 I finished the latter with a focus on theoretical aspects; my thesis was called Linear Temporal Logics Over Data Strings (and I assume I am one of three people who actually read it).

When that was over, I needed some time off‚Ä¶

### Fraunhofer ISI

After some soul searching months I started working as a software developer for the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, where I was developing energy market simulations in Java and VB.NET.

It was here that I discovered my passion for software development. Having access to all the great and free online sources about software development in general and Java in particular helped me learn a lot. In 2014 I decided to return the favor and started this blog as well as contributing to open source projects.

In late summer of 2014 I left the institute and looked for a new place to hone my skills‚Ä¶

### Disy

I found it at Disy Informationssysteme, the leading provider for spatial and environmental IT-solutions in Germany. Here I learned the challenges of maintaining and improving a large, old, and business-critical code base. A dedicated team with a couple of brilliant people in there made this an experience I don‚Äôt want to miss.

On the non-coding side I continued my quest to annoy people with my suggestions and ideas. Some experiments failed but others stuck: I introduced code reviews and designed our review workflow, helped people become productive with Java 8, and was a general pain when it came to clean coding practices. I also started regular meetings, where we had beer and talked about code, organized a JUG meeting and built Disy‚Äôs TechBlog. I‚Äôm sure there was more but I‚Äôm not one to boast (yeah, sure).

It was with a heavy heart that I left Disy in summer 2016‚Ä¶

### SitePoint et al

But I could just not say no to the opportunity SitePoint offered me: Becoming an editor and building a Java channel from the ground up. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing ever since.

Besides everything else of course. A book about Project Jigsaw, this blog, writing gigs, talking at conferences, trainings, consulting ‚Äì I guess I‚Äôll be busy. Ah yeah, and I guess I should be coding somewhere in between.
Free and Open Source Software
Nicolai is a gold member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
Nicolai is a fellow of the Free Software Foundation Europe
Nicolai donates to the Mozilla Foundation

I‚Äôm a big proponent of digital rights and particularly Free and Open Source Software. I am a member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Software Foundation Europe, and financially support selected projects.

In 2014 I finally started contributing code and even though it has just been on a small scale, working on free software became very important for me. I describe myself as a long tail contributor because so far there has been no single project that I became part of ‚Äì it‚Äôs just small improvements here and there. I used to list them here but when they become more frequent that stopped making sense. If you are curious, check out my GitHub profile.

I have my own open source library LibFX, in which I collect all kinds of reusable functionality. The initial ideas and implementations usually emerge in some other project. After generalizing, polishing and thorough testing, I include the code in LibFX.

Then there is JDeps Mvn, a Maven plugin running JDeps on the compiled classes and failing the build for dependencies on JDK-internal APIs. It‚Äôs specialty is the ability to easily define exceptions from build-breaking for known dependencies that could not yet be removed.

Last but not least, I‚Äôm a founding member of Do-FOSS, an initiative which advances the use of Free and Open Source Software in the city of Dortmund.

### Blogging

Initially, I considered this whole blogging thing a hobby, aimed at improving my knowledge and giving back to the great community which enabled me to even call myself a developer (as opposed to just some guy hacking away at his keyboard). But after about a year and a half it turned into much more. Researching topics that really interested me, I inadvertently acquired knowledge that others seek.

<contentimage slug="nicolai-parlog" options="sidebar"></contentimage>

This enabled me to speak at conferences and writing became a (semi-)professional activity. It also gave me the chance to diversify my work life! If you need someone to write, speak, teach, or consult about bleeding edge topics like Project Jigsaw, Java 9, JUnit 5, Clean Comments, or Java in general, you should ping me ‚Äì I am for hire.
