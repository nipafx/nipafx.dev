## Liability for Links

This website contains links to external sites whose content I have no influence on and can therefore assume no responsibility for.
Instead, it is quite obviously the provider of those pages who's responsible for them.

<contentimage slug="duh" options="sidebar"></contentimage>

That said, when initially creating a link I checked the linked page for possible violations of the law and couldn't recognize anything illegal.
A permanent control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete proof of a violation of the law.
When you know of such a violation, please [report it](contact), so I can remove the link immediately.

## Copyright
