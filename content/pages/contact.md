description: "Whether to ask a Java question, give feedback on this blog, or just hang out and chat - here's how to get in touch"
---

To the point:

* [email](mailto:nicolai@nipafx.dev)
* [Twitter DM](https://twitter/nipafx)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7m9w8Td)
* [this site on GitHub](https://github.com/nipafx/nipafx.dev)

I generally prefer email, but Twitter DMs are also a good way to get in touch, particularly if it's urgent.
If you just want to chat with me or a few other Java geeks, give the Discord a go.
In case there's something wrong with the site, opening an issue on GitHub is the best way to let me know.

If your request is a technical Java question, I encourage you to ask it in a public forum, preferably on [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com/), so everybody can benefit from the answer.
Feel free to send me a link to your question if you think I can help.
