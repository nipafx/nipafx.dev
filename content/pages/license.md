## Texts

All texts on this website that are not explicitly marked as quotes were written by myself and I would love for you to share them non-commercially as long as you provide attribution.

Formally, that means such texts are licensed under [CC-BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

### Commercial Use

An exact definition of _commercial use_ is impossible, but here are some guidelines as to how I interpret it in this context:

-   it is **ok** to reuse my texts on your website as long as it displays no ads and offers no paid products or services
-   it is **ok** to reuse my texts for a free book (electronic or paper) as long as it advertizes no paid products or services
-   it is **ok** to reuse my texts for conference talks as long as you don't charge a speaker fee (if travel expenses are reimbursed, that's ok with me)

If you are in any way unsure of the legality of your intended use case or I simply missed to include it, please [get in touch](contact).

### Attribution

To provide proper attribution, please mention my full name (_Nicolai Parlog_) and link to this website (_https://nipafx.dev_) close to where you reused the content.

If you publish large parts or entire posts on your website, attribution must also include a [canonical URL](https://yoast.com/what-is-a-canonical-url/) linking back to the exact page containing the original content.

### Nota Bene

Note that [CC-BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) also requires you to link to the license and indicate whether you made any changes.

## Code

Unless otherwise noted, all code shown on this website was written by myself.
A decent portion of it comes from various demo repositories that usually have permissive licenses.
The repos are linked from the corresponding blog post and you should check them out if you want to reuse larger chunks of code.

That said, unless otherwise noted, all snippets found on this website can be reused in your projects under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Images

Most of the images on this website were not created by me - they usually come with links to source, artist, and license.
Many of them were graciously shared by their creators and you should be ok reusing them the same way I do, but this is no legal advice and you should always check the source and license.

Then there are a few images that I did create myself.
You will recognize them by linking to _nipafx.dev_ as the artist.
As with the other images, they also mention the license under which you can reuse them - in case it's [CC-BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), what I've written above about commercial use and attribution applies here as well.

Lastly, there are a few pictures without copyright information.
This is the case where I couldn't find any (e.g. memes) or where I doubt it qualifies for copyright (e.g. screenshots).
Be careful with reusing them.
