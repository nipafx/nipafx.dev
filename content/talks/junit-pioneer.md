JUnit is a huge success and [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5) is an amazing overhaul of a tried-and-true formula.
One of its most enticing new designs is [its extension model](https://nipafx.dev/junit-5-extension-model/), which is where [JUnit Pioneer](https://junit-pioneer.org/) comes in.
It's a small project gathering all kinds of extensions.

In this talk, we're going to take a close look at the project and we won't just stick to the technical aspects:

* JUnit 5 and its extension model
* Pioneer's extensions
* Pioneer's mission statement
* how live-streaming on Twitch grew a community
* organizational style, contribution guide
* code style, Git practices, release considerations
* how we use Shipkit and GitHub actions for one-click releases

If you're maintaining your own small open source project or are interested in a peek behind the scenes, this talk is for you.
