Java 21 was an explosive release and since then, Java has shown no signs of slowing down:

* from unnamed patterns to module imports
* from the foreign-function and memory API to stream gatherers and the class-file API
* from a simpler `main` to launching multi-source-file programs
* from Markdown in JavaDoc to improved garbage collection

There are plenty of features in the language, API, and runtime to discuss - whether new, improved, or finalized.
So let's go over them!

Java 25 will be the next release with wide-ranging long-term support and it's a doozy:

* from unnamed patterns to module imports
* from the foreign-function and memory API to stream gatherers and the class-file API
* from a simpler `main` to launching multi-source-file programs
* from Markdown in JavaDoc to quantum-resistend encryption
* from faster launch times to improved garbage collection

There are plenty of features in the language, API, and runtime to discuss - whether new, improved, or finalized. So let's go over them!
