Java 21 was an explosive release, but 22 and 23 are no slouches either:

* from unnamed patterns to module imports
* from the foreign-function and memory API to stream gatherers and the class-file API
* from a simpler `main` to launching multi-source-file programs
* from Markdown in JavaDoc to improved garbage collection

There are plenty of features in the language, API, and runtime to discuss - whether new, improved, or finalized.
So let's go over them!
