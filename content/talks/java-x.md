The faster release cadence made Java more nimble and the shorter LTS cycle allows more projects to adopt it.
An increasing number of Java developers is already or will soon use Java's newest features, so lets go over them:

* new language features like sealed types, pattern matching, records, and switch expressions
* the additions to existing APIs, like `Stream`, random number generation, and socket channels
* other niceties like multi-release JARs, performance improvements, and observability

After this talk you will be prepared to get started with modern Java's most recent release.
