Java 21 is an explosive release!
The fuse was lit by projects Loom and Amber and 21 blows it up by finalizing **virtual threads** and all basic building blocks of **pattern matching**, thus bringing simple scalability to the platform and modern constructs to the language.

But it doesn't stop there: **better APIs, better garbage collection, better tooling** - particularly when you're coming from 17, the improvements will be ubiquitous.
And beyond all that, Java 21 is fizzling with future:
There are **previews** on string templates, a simplified `main`, pattern matching refinements, and improved concurrency with virtual threads.
Not least, many vendors offer **long-term support** for their JDK 21 builds, so if you're on 17 or 11 (or 8?), this is the next version to upgrade to.

In this talk, we'll go over all that, so you can hit the ground running when updating to Java 21.
Disclaimer: It will be a blast!

The faster release cadence made Java more nimble and the shorter LTS cycle allows more projects to adopt it.
An increasing number of Java developers is already or will soon use Java's newest features, so lets go over them:

* new language features like sealed types, pattern matching, records, and switch expressions
* the additions to existing APIs, like `Stream`, random number generation, and socket channels
* other niceties like multi-release JARs, performance improvements, and observability

After this talk you will be prepared to get started with modern Java's most recent release.
