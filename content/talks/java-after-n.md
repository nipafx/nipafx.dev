Most projects that updated stick to the long-term support versions 11 or 17.
The new cadence created the illusion of not much happening in between and after that, but nothing could be further from the truth - with new features like pattern matching, virtual threads, and structured concurrency, Java is moving faster than ever.

In this talk, we'll take a simple Java 17 code base, update it to 21, and refactor it to use the new Java capabilities.
