Many Java projects ([by some counts](https://snyk.io/jvm-ecosystem-report-2021/), over half) run on Java versions that support the module system and Maven Central offers [over 4.200 modules](https://github.com/sormuras/modules/blob/main/com.github.sormuras.modules/com/github/sormuras/modules/modules.properties).
If you think about creating modules for your (next) project, you may have some questions:

* Why use modules?
* Incremental modularization
* What are common or tricky roadblocks?
* Where's the exit?!
* When (not) to use modules?

In this talk, I'll answer these questions, so you can better decide whether modules are right for your project.
