Pattern Matching is finding its way into Java, one step at a time, along three paths:

* support for patterns
	* starting with type patterns (in Java 16)
	* next are deconstruction patterns (candidate for preview in Java 18)
* improvements of `switch`
	* making it an expression (in Java 14)
	* supporting patterns (preview in Java 17)
* sealed classes (in Java 17)

In this presentation, we'll follow these three paths to see them all come together for a happy end.
We'll also discuss when (not) to use pattern matching, so you can make the right choices from day one.
