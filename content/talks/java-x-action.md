So you learned about all these new Java features but want to see how they come together?
Then let's write a GitHub Crawler and let's throw in everything Java (22) has to offer:

* virtual threads and structured concurrency
* pattern matching and data-oriented programming
* type inference, records, and sealed types
* text blocks ~~and template strings~~
* a modern HTTP client and improved collections
* modules and OS-specific binaries

The end result will look very different from just a few years ago, let alone 10.
This is not your parents' Java!
