Let's write a GitHub Crawler and let's throw in everything Java (21) has to offer:

* virtual threads and structured concurrency
* pattern matching and data-oriented programming
* type inference, records, and sealed types
* text blocks and template strings
* a modern HTTP client and improved collections
* modules and OS-specific binaries

The end result will look very different from just a few years ago, let alone 10.
This is not your dad's Java!
