Java's most ubiquitous library got an update! This talk...

* shows you how to write tests with JUnit 5
* walks you through the changes compared to JUnit 4
* expands on nested, parameterized, parallel and other kinds of tests
* tells you how to build your own JUnit 5 extensions
* presents the new architecture
* discusses compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other testing tools

Be careful, though:
You might end up with an urge to start using it right away.

## Pitch

Since fall of 2015 a small, dedicated team has been working on the next version of Java's most ubiquitous project.
A general availability release was made on September 10th, 2017.
This is the next generation of testing in Java (and maybe even the JVM as a whole).

This talk is based on an [ongoing series of articles I am publishing on my blog](http://blog.codefx.org/tag/junit-5). I already held it at various conferences.
