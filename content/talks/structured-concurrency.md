In Java 25, the structured concurrency API sees its fifth preview with considerable changes over previous iterations.
With chances being good that it will finalize without a further overhaul, let's put it into action and explore how to:

* process and propagate errors and cancellation
* observe thread relationships
* refactor from a reactive approach

After this presentation you'll be ready to put the structured concurrency API into action in your project.
