Java's four big projects are entering the home stretch:
Amber and Panama have already incubated, previewed, and even finalized some features, Loom and Valhalla are on track to follow soon.
Time to take a closer look at how...

* Project Amber makes the language more expressive and ready for today's and tomorrow's problems
* Project Panama cuts through the isthmus separating Java from native code
* Project Loom enables hassle-free and efficient structured concurrency
* Project Valhalla mends the rift in Java's type system and improves performance

After this talk, you will know what to expect from Java in the next few years.
