Java's six big projects are shaping its future and some of that is already here - just not evenly distributed.
Loom has mostly delivered and is now tying up some loose ends, whereas Amber and Panama are still in the midst of finalizing their features.
Valhalla is on track to preview soon but Babylon and Leyden are just starting out.
Time to take a closer look at how...

* Project Loom further improves efficient, structured concurrency
* Project Amber makes the language more expressive and ready for today's and tomorrow's problems
* Project Panama cuts through the isthmus separating Java from native code
* Project Babylon extends the reach of Java to foreign programming models
* Project Valhalla mends the rift in Java's type system and improves performance
* Project Leyden improves Java's startup time, time to peak performance, and footprint

After this talk, you will know what to expect from Java in the next few years.
