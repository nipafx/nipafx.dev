The faster release cadence made Java more nimble and the shorter LTS cycle allows more projects to adopt it.
An increasing number of Java developers is already or will soon use Java's newest additions, from new language features like pattern matching and records to lots of API improvements, from better scalability with virtual threads to multi-release JARs, performance improvements, better observability, and so much more.
Then there are Java's six big projects, which are in different stages in their lifecycle: Amber, Loom, and Panama; Valhalla, Leyden, and Babylon.

If you have questions about any of that, this is your chance to ask them and I'll do my best to answer.
