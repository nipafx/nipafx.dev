Hey, I'm nipafx, but you can call me Nicolai and today it's gonna be you, Kevin Bourrillion, and [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/).
This is from a live stream [on my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/nipafx) a few months ago and while I was there, too, and so was Manu Sridharan, this video contains just Kevin's presentation about JSpecify, a project spearheading a set of standard annotations for Java static analysis, specifically for tracking null.
After Kevin gave us a great overview, we had a detailed conversation about the project, including an illuminating exchange on Project Valhalla and why it cares about null, but to keep this video short-ish and sweet I'll upload that separately, hopefully before the year ends.
This video is just the introduction to JSpecify.
Enjoy!

And wouldn't you like to know?!
I'll upload the answer to that as well as to the audience questions and the rest of the conversation soon.
You may also have spotted that we skipped section 3 of Kevin's presentation.
That was the part on Project Valhalla and I will upload that as well as our conversation about it in a third video.
If you're watching this in the future, they may already be out and appear next to me.
Otherwise, subscribe, so you don't miss them.
So long...
