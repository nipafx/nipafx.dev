## Interruption

Hey, Nicolai from the February 2022 here.
Given that this conversation between Brian Goetz and me happened in May 2021, it held up exceptionally well.
Almost everything that was said still applies.

In fact, the only exception may be what Brian just said about switch making total patterns match `null`.
There's a discussion about that on the Project Amber Spec mailing list happening right now.
[It's linked in the description](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2022-January/003194.html) - very illuminating.
While you're down there, you can do me a favor and like this video if you enjoy it and subscribe to the channel for more Java content.

Take your time, I'll wait...
Ready?
Great, then let's dive back into the conversation, which now moves on to exhaustiveness of switch statements.
