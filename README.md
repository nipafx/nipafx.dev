My Gatsby site.

## Content

The site shows various kinds of content, like blog posts, YouTube videos, newsletters, and more.
To keep things organized, I defined some terms:

* _Article_: What is usually called a blog post - a proper article on any topic
* _Event_: Announcements of Accento, 26 Hours Of Java, etc.
* _Talks_: An abstract and list of presentations for a talk
* _Video_: A post linking to a YouTube video
* _Post_: Each of the above is a _post_
